# Solver
# The solver will expect one filename argument.
# The first line of that file will be the parameters N, p, and q, separated by spaces.
# The N file lines that follow will give the N puzzle lines, one puzzle line on each 
# file line. Tokens will be represented as above. Blank cells will be represented as a
# zero. Tokens and zeroes will be separated by spaces. For example, the input file for 
# a 6x6 puzzle with boxes that are 2 rows by 3 columns might look like:
# 6 2 3
# 5 0 0 3 0 0
# 0 0 2 0 0 4
# 4 3 0 0 5 0
# 0 0 1 2 0 0
# 1 0 0 0 4 0
# 0 2 0 0 1 5
